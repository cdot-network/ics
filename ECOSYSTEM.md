## Interblockchain Communication Protocol Ecosystem

If you are interested in contributing to the IBC ecosystem, please join the [Ecosystem Working Group](./ecosystem).

### Handler implementations

Implementations of the canonical IBC protocol & handler as defined in the specification.

Suitable for integration with blockchains written in the respective client languages.
