## IBC Ecosystem Working Group

### Purpose

The evolution of IBC requires cross-industry collaboration to support developing standards that are secure, open, and deployable. The IBC ecosystem working group is a growing team of contributors supporting the standardisation of blockchain development from protocol level to applications. Join the [mailing list](https://zc.vg/sf/giAEr) for email and meeting updates.

Currently the IBC working group is being actively led and managed by Tendermint (All in Bits), Agoric and the Interchain Foundation. Over time, we anticipate this will shift into breakout working groups and a more decentralised way of managing the interoperability standards development process.

### Structure

Following each IBC working group meeting, a new issue for the next meeting will be created with a proposed agenda for comments and collaboration from the larger working group. During the two-week timeframe between calls, we invite IBC working group members to contribute to the next meeting's agenda and join the bi-weekly call to discuss the topics in conjunction with the IBC core team. Upon concluding a meeting, a recording will be posted and the details and notes will be published in the associated issue and linked to in this file.
